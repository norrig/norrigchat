# norrigchat
A work-in-progress ultra simple chat system with basic symmetrical encryption. 
Supports JWT based login and a field for custom fernet keys.

Backend made in Python (with love) with Flask and socket.io. 
Frontend coded in javascript(not with love) and basic html/css.


BEWARE: I do not recommend you use this project for anything, it's used as a school project and likely riddled with security issues and bugs.
